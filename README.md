### ⚛️ What's this?

This is a simple web app created for the online training in Adalab's bootcamp. It's developed by [Alexandra Jara](https://github.com/alexandrajaramz), using React.

It's a list of Pokemons (like [pokedex.org](http://pokedex.org)), and the requested features were:
- List of the 25 first Pokemon using [pokeapi.co](https://pokeapi.co/).
- Show the image, name, number and type or types of each Pokemon (double fetch).
- Filter Pokemons by name.
